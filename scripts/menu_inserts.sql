Instead, we combine a savory base of shiitake mushrooms and kombu seaweed with creamy soy milk and sake kasu (sake lees) from the renowned Akishika Sake Brewery. The result is a smooth, mellow soup that warms you from the inside out. We use Kāchan Miso, a lovingly made local miso from Toyono Town, to give the bowl a home-style richness. On top, our special vegan 'meat miso' is made from pea-based plant protein and enhanced with a secret ingredient that brings everything together beautifully. Enjoy the deep, nutty aroma and complex flavor of this plant-powered tantanmen—it might just change your mind about vegan ramen.","availableAt":["Dinner"]}$$) ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET payload = EXCLUDED.payload;
